Ignoring funding and t-costs, the return of our leveraged ETP, $L$, is $\lambda$ (the leverage ratio) times the return of the reference instrument $S$, i.e.

$$
dL = L \lambda \frac{d S_t}{S}
$$

- it applies to a continuously rebalanced strategy and rebalancing won't be that perfect in practice 

    - only an approximation
    
    
Assume the reference ETF follows GBM so that:

$$
d S = \mu S dt + \sigma S d z
$$

The crude idea behind the rebalancing strategy is to obtain a payoff of the form 

$$
\left(\frac{S}{S_0}\right)^\lambda
$$

We use this to guess the form of the evolution of the leveraged ETP value using the ansatz:

$$
L = L_0 \left(\frac{S}{S_0}\right)^\lambda \left(-\frac{1}{2} \lambda (\lambda - 1) \sigma^2 t\right)
$$ 

Applying Ito's lemma, we can show that indeed

$$
dL = L \lambda \frac{d S_t}{S}
$$

Therefore, 


$$
L = L_0 \left(\frac{S}{S_0}\right)^\lambda \left(-\frac{1}{2} \lambda (\lambda - 1) \sigma^2 t\right)
$$ 


is indeed the solution.

Note that this has two parts:

1. the naive leveraged return

2. the drag due to realised variance


While it is usually the case that leveraged ETP underperforms due to large realised variance, it is also possible the first term to dominate the second

- i.e. outperform when market steadily goes up

### Trading realised vol without options


Let's buy one dollar of $L$ and sell short $\lambda$ dollars of $S$ (and $\lambda < 0$ this would mea that we would be buying $L$). At any given time our account equity is 

$$
E = \frac{L}{L_0} - \lambda \frac{S}{S_0} - (1-\lambda)
$$

- the last term is the cash credit or debit for initiating the position


Using the functional form of $L$:

$$
L = L_0 \left(\frac{S}{S_0}\right)^\lambda \left(-\frac{1}{2} \lambda (\lambda - 1) \sigma^2 t\right)
$$ 

we get:

$$
E = \left(\frac{S}{S_0}\right)^\lambda \left(-\frac{1}{2} \lambda (\lambda - 1) \sigma^2 t\right) - \lambda \frac{S}{S_0} - (1-\lambda)
$$


If $\lambda = 2$, we have 

$$
E = \left(\frac{S}{S_0}\right)^2 \exp\left(-\sigma^2 t\right) - 2 \frac{S}{S_0} + 1
$$


This is a parabolic function of the scaled reference fund value.

This portfolio behaves like a long straddle:

- large moves make money but also incur time decay

- also shorting realised volatity



To make money , we need steady, presistent moves, the break-even levels are given by


$$
\frac{S}{S_0} = \exp\left(\sigma^2 t\right) \left(1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \exp \left(-\sigma^2 t\right)}\right)
$$
